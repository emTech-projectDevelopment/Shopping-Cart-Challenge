Within the code you will find the usual html css and js stack with (hopefully) well enoughed detailed descriptions allowing you to understand and navigate your way around.

The requirements for this coding challenge were met pretty much through determintion and googling.

Exploring console.log statements allowed me to find my way around tricky code and some squishy coding was cleaned up with nicer iterations within functions. Learning to populate a div with object elements in an array was the trickiest but i was very happy with the written result of code.

Happy Coding!
